# Project: langchains

## Overview

The "langchains" project is designed to demonstrate how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered features can be organized and integrated into a minimal, modular Python application. The goal is to provide a straightforward and extensible codebase where students can learn the essentials of using LLM Chains and Agents (powered by the [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) library), optionally incorporate conversation memory, and showcase everything through a simple UI built with Flask and React.

### Purpose of the Project
• Provide a reference implementation that demonstrates how to build and structure an LLM-driven application.  
• Show how to create a basic chain (prompt in, response out) and agent-based decision-making (with or without tools).  
• Illustrate how conversation memory can be managed across multiple user sessions.  
• Offer a minimal UI as an example of an interactive front-end using Flask and React.  

### Project Architecture
1. **Core (FastAPI)**: The main MVP codebase that provides REST endpoints for chains, agents, memory, and tools.  
2. **Chains Module**: Manages the creation of simple or more advanced chain flows to handle prompt templates and LLM steps.  
3. **Agents Module**: Defines AI agents capable of reasoning about tasks and calling tools to gather necessary data or perform calculations.  
4. **Memory Module**: Tracks conversation or session context to allow stateful interactions.  
5. **Tools Module**: Encapsulates specialized functions (like a search or calculator tool) that an agent can invoke.  
6. **Flask + React Demo**: Demonstrates how you might integrate with the Core MVP from a separate lightweight server and UI.  

### Design Decisions
• **FastAPI** for the main API: Chosen for its speed, built-in data validation (with Pydantic), and straightforward setup.  
• **LangChain** for LLM logic: Provides a standardized way to build chains and agents.  
• **Modular Approach**: Each domain-specific concern (Chains, Agents, Memory, Tools) is isolated, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain.  
• **Optional Database**: Using SQLAlchemy if you wish to store messages, session info, or chain states, while still allowing SQLite or Postgres as a backend.  
• **Flask + React for Demo**: Demonstrates how you might consume the FastAPI endpoints from another framework or in a microservices approach.  

### Key Technologies and Concepts
• **LangChain**: Enabling LLM usage, chain creation (prompt engineering), agents with tools, and memory management.  
• **FastAPI**: Modern web framework offering quick setup and productive development.  
• **Pydantic**: Data parsing and validation for Python, heavily used by FastAPI.  
• **SQLAlchemy**: Optional ORM to manage relational databases in Python.  
• **Flask**: Lightweight server for the example UI integration.  
• **React**: Front-end JavaScript library to showcase a minimal user interface.

## Core

The Core module is the backbone of the application. It is where you configure the FastAPI application, handle configuration loading, and optionally manage database connections. By isolating these responsibilities, the rest of the modules (Chains, Agents, Memory, Tools) can use Core’s services without worrying about how everything is set up.

### How Core Fits in the Overall Architecture
• **Central API**: Exposes endpoints mounted from each of the submodules (Chains, Agents, etc.).  
• **Configuration**: Loads environment variables or config files, making them available application-wide.  
• **Database Connection**: Optionally provides a database URL or session factory if the modules need persistent storage.  

Below, we examine the main tasks within the Core module.

### Task: Create App

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• This function initializes a FastAPI application, sets up any middlewares needed, and includes routers from the Chains, Agents, Memory, and Tools modules.  
• It must be flexible enough to allow additions or removals of modules without requiring a complete rewrite.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: None, though it may load environment/config settings internally.  
• **Output**: A FastAPI application instance.  
• **Behavior**: Returns a fully configured FastAPI app, ready to mount sub-route handlers.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Create a new FastAPI instance.  
2. Mount the routers from each submodule (e.g., chains_router, agents_router, etc.).  
3. Optionally include middleware for logging, CORS, or request/response transformation.  
4. Load any global configuration settings.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Create App</summary>

Conceptually, you might do something like this (pseudo-code):

• Initialize FastAPI:  
  fastapi_app = FastAPI()

• Include routers:  
  fastapi_app.include_router(chains_router, prefix="/chains")  
  fastapi_app.include_router(agents_router, prefix="/agents")  
  fastapi_app.include_router(memory_router, prefix="/memory")  
  fastapi_app.include_router(tools_router, prefix="/tools")

• Return the app:  
  return fastapi_app
</details>

---

### Task: Run App

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• This function launches the FastAPI application, typically on a specified host and port.  
• It might optionally be omitted if relying on external tools like Uvicorn or Gunicorn.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: The application instance or a config object specifying host/port.  
• **Output**: None, but it starts the server in a blocking IO loop.  
• **Behavior**: Initiates the HTTP server, listening on a configurable port.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Parse relevant configuration for port, host, or debug mode.  
2. Create or reuse the FastAPI app instance.  
3. Call the server run command (e.g., uvicorn.run(...)) with the specified parameters.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Run App</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• load configs -> host/port  
• uvicorn.run(app, host=host, port=port)
</details>

### Task: Load Config

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• Gathers necessary environment variables or reads from a `.env`/config file to configure the application.  
• Ensures that the rest of the code can rely on a coherent configuration state.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: None (generally reads from the environment or a file).  
• **Output**: A dictionary or custom config object containing settings.  
• **Behavior**: Must handle missing or incorrect config gracefully, providing defaults or raising errors if critical.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Check environment variables (e.g., `os.environ` or `python-dotenv`).  
2. Parse or validate these values using Pydantic or a similar approach.  
3. Return a structured config object or dictionary.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Load Config</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• from dotenv import load_dotenv  
• load_dotenv()  
• config_value = os.getenv("SOME_KEY", "default_value")  
• return config object or dictionary
</details>

### Task: Get Database Url

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• Constructs a valid database connection string to be used by SQLAlchemy.  
• Must account for various database types (e.g., Postgres, SQLite).  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: Configuration details such as DB type, host, username, password.  
• **Output**: A string formatted according to SQLAlchemy’s engine requirements, e.g., `"postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host/db"`.  
• **Behavior**: Should handle different cases (e.g., local SQLite vs. remote Postgres).  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Read database-related config from environment.  
2. Construct the url string.  
3. Return it for usage in the rest of the modules.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Get Database Url</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• db_type = config["DB_TYPE"]  
• if db_type == "sqlite":  
  url = f"sqlite:///{db_path}"  
• elif db_type == "postgres":  
  url = f"postgresql+psycopg2://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db_name}"  
• return url
</details>

## Chains

The Chains module focuses on the creation and execution of textual transformations using an LLM. Typically, you might have a simple chain that accepts user input and returns a direct response, or more complex sequential chains performing multiple steps.

### How Chains Fit into the Overall Architecture
• Provide endpoints for generating text based on a single prompt or a series of steps.  
• Tie in with the Core module for routing and potential database interactions.  
• Other modules (Agents, Memory) can build upon or wrap these chain functionalities.  

Below are the main tasks within the Chains module.

### Task: Generate Text Endpoint(request_data)

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• Exposes an API endpoint that consumes user input from the request body and invokes the underlying chain logic.  
• Returns generated text from the LLM.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: `request_data` (JSON body) containing the user’s query, parameters, or chain configuration.  
• **Output**: A JSON response with the generated text.  
• **Behavior**: Must handle success, error cases, and perhaps partial or fallback responses if the LLM call fails.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Parse the user query and any special instructions from `request_data`.  
2. Pass the query to the chain (e.g., `build_simple_chain(...)`).  
3. Receive the LLM’s response.  
4. Format and return the result as JSON.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Generate Text Endpoint(request_data)</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• def generate_text_endpoint(request_data):  
  ├─ user_prompt = request_data["prompt"]  
  ├─ chain = build_simple_chain(llm_provider)  
  └─ response_text = chain.run(user_prompt)  
  return {"result": response_text}
</details>

---

### Task: Build Simple Chain(llm_provider)

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• Constructs a minimal LangChain instance with a single-step prompt.  
• Allows injection of an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face) to keep it flexible.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: `llm_provider` or configuration for your chosen LLM model.  
• **Output**: A chain object that can be run with a prompt.  
• **Behavior**: Should handle the prompt, generate a completion, and return the result.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Instantiate a chain object from LangChain, typically referencing a prompt template and an LLM.  
2. Optionally include a few shots or custom parameters for better performance.  
3. Return the chain ready for usage.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Build Simple Chain(llm_provider)</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• chain = LLMChain(
    llm=llm_provider,
    prompt=some_prompt_template
  )  
• return chain
</details>

---

## Agents

Agents introduce decision-making to your system. Instead of simply mapping a prompt to a response, an agent can break down complex requests, use tools, and plan how to respond.

### How Agents Fit into the Overall Architecture
• Extend the core chain concept to handle multi-step reasoning and tool usage.  
• Provide endpoints for advanced queries requiring external data or specialized computation.  
• Rely on the Tools module for implementable functions and the Memory module for preserving context across steps.  

Below are the main tasks within the Agents module.

---

### Task: Agent Query Endpoint(request_data)

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• An API endpoint that receives a query and delegates processing to an agent.  
• The agent may call multiple tools before arriving at a final answer.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: `request_data` containing the user’s question and possibly metadata (session ID, etc.).  
• **Output**: The agent’s final answer and perhaps a reasoning trace if desired.  
• **Behavior**: Must handle agent steps, tool calls, and return the end result.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Parse the incoming query.  
2. Pass the query to the designated agent.  
3. The agent orchestrates chain-of-thought steps and tool usage if necessary.  
4. Collect the final response and return it to the user.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Agent Query Endpoint(request_data)</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• def agent_query_endpoint(request_data):  
  ├─ user_query = request_data["query"]  
  ├─ agent = create_basic_agent([search_tool, calculator_tool])  
  └─ final_answer = run_agent_query(agent, user_query)  
  return {"answer": final_answer}
</details>

---

### Task: Create Basic Agent(tools)

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• Initializes a simple agent that can call a predefined set of tools.  
• Defines how the agent decides to use those tools.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: A list or dictionary of available tools.  
• **Output**: Fully configured agent instance.  
• **Behavior**: Agent is capable of receiving queries and determining whether to use a tool (like a search or calculator) to fulfill the request.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Create a standard agent from LangChain (e.g., ZeroShotAgent, ConversationalAgent, etc.).  
2. Register the list of tools with the agent.  
3. Return this configured agent instance.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Create Basic Agent(tools)</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=some_llm,
    agent_type="zero-shot"
  )  
• return agent
</details>

---

### Task: Run Agent Query(agent, user_query)

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• Accepts an agent and a user query, then orchestrates the steps required for the agent to produce an answer.  
• Involves the chain-of-thought reasoning, deciding when and how to invoke each tool.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: An agent instance, and a `user_query` string.  
• **Output**: The final textual output from the agent.  
• **Behavior**: The agent can defer to multiple tools or call the LLM multiple times.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Pass the user query to the agent’s main execution method.  
2. The agent uses a hidden chain-of-thought process to decide on tool usage.  
3. Once the agent determines it has a final answer, it returns it to the caller.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Run Agent Query(agent, user_query)</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• final_answer = agent.run(user_query)  
• return final_answer
</details>

## Memory

Memory allows your application to maintain a contextual conversation flow across multiple interactions. For instance, storing user messages and AI responses to produce more coherent, context-rich answers.

### How Memory Fits into the Overall Architecture
• Provides endpoints that let you fetch or clear conversation state.  
• Links with the Agents and Chains modules to supply relevant context from previous exchanges.  
• Can store data in-memory or in a persistent database.  

Below are the main tasks within the Memory module.

---

### Task: Get Memory State Endpoint(session_id)

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• Exposes an API endpoint to retrieve the conversation history or memory content associated with a particular session.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: A `session_id` to look up the correct conversation.  
• **Output**: A structured conversation history or memory state.  
• **Behavior**: Avoid returning data from other sessions. Might require authentication or checks.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Receive the `session_id` from the endpoint path or query.  
2. Query the memory store (in-memory dictionary, database, etc.) for that session’s data.  
3. Return the data in a suitable JSON format.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Get Memory State Endpoint(session_id)</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• def get_memory_state_endpoint(session_id):  
  ├─ memory_data = retrieve_memory(session_id)  
  └─ return {"memory": memory_data}
</details>

---

### Task: Clear Memory Endpoint(session_id)

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• Provides an API route to reset or delete stored conversation content for a given session.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: A `session_id` referencing the conversation to be cleared.  
• **Output**: A success/failure message indicating the operation’s result.  
• **Behavior**: Ensures that once cleared, the conversation state is removed or reset to empty.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Identify which session’s memory to clear.  
2. Remove or overwrite that data in your storage layer.  
3. Confirm the operation is successful.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Clear Memory Endpoint(session_id)</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• def clear_memory_endpoint(session_id):  
  ├─ memory_store[session_id] = []  
  └─ return {"status": "cleared"}
</details>

---

Pseudo-code approach:

• def store_message(session_id, message):  
  ├─ memory = memory_store.get(session_id, [])  
  ├─ memory.append(message)  
  └─ memory_store[session_id] = memory
</details>

---

### Task: Retrieve Memory(session_id)

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• A backend function (not necessarily an endpoint) that fetches the full conversation history for a given session.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**

<summary>Hint: General pattern for Retrieve Memory(session_id)</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• def retrieve_memory(session_id):  
  ├─ return memory_store.get(session_id, [])
</details>

---

## Tools

The Tools module defines specialized functions that Agents or Chains can invoke to accomplish specific tasks (for example, searching a database, calling an external API, or performing calculations).

### How Tools Fit into the Overall Architecture
• Extend the capabilities of Agents beyond the base LLM.  
• Decouple tool logic from agent logic, making tools reusable.  
• Often shared across multiple agent types.  

Below are the main tasks within the Tools module.

---

### Task: Call Tool Endpoint(tool_name, tool_input)

**Purpose and Requirements**

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: `tool_name`, `tool_input` data.  
• **Output**: The result of calling the specified tool.  
• **Behavior**: Must handle missing or invalid tool names gracefully.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Look up the tool by `tool_name` in a registry or dictionary.  
2. Call the tool with `tool_input`.  
3. Return the tool’s output in JSON.  

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Call Tool Endpoint(tool_name, tool_input)</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• def call_tool_endpoint(tool_name, tool_input):  
  ├─ if tool_name == "search":

• return results
</details>

---

### Task: Calculator Tool(expression)

**Purpose and Requirements**  
• Evaluates a mathematical expression.  
• Typically used by an Agent that needs to perform arithmetic.  

**Inputs, Outputs, and Expected Behavior**  
• **Input**: A string or object representing a math expression (e.g., "2+2").  
• **Output**: Evaluation result as a number or string.  
• **Behavior**: Should handle potential errors (e.g., division by zero) gracefully.  

**Conceptual Implementation Approach**  
1. Parse the expression string.  
2. Evaluate the expression, either with Python’s `eval`-like function or a math library (with caution).  
3. Return the computed value.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Calculator Tool(expression)</summary>

Pseudo-code approach:

• result = eval(expression)  
• return str(result)
</details>

---

## Testing and Validation

To ensure your `langchains` project works end-to-end:

1. **Unit Tests**: For each module (Chains, Agents, Memory, Tools), write tests that confirm each function works in isolation.  
2. **Integration Tests**: Spin up the FastAPI server in a test environment. Then, send requests to the endpoints (Chains, Agents, etc.) and verify responses.  
3. **UI Testing**: If using the Flask + React demo, ensure the front-end correctly sends requests and displays responses.  

During testing, pay attention to the following:  
• **Edge Cases**: What happens if the user’s input is empty or invalid? What if no results are returned from a search tool?  
• **Concurrent Sessions**: If multiple users or sessions are active, does the memory store track them correctly?  
• **Performance**: LLM calls and search queries might be slow; implement timeouts or handle exceptions gracefully.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

• **Misconfigured Environments**: Failing to load environment variables or database settings can cause startup failures.  
• **Dependency Conflicts**: Make sure you’re using compatible versions of LangChain, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.  
• **Incorrect Tool Names**: If an agent tries to call a tool that’s not registered or spelled incorrectly, it will fail.  
• **Session Mix-ups**: Storing or retrieving memory from the wrong session can lead to confusing conversation flows.  
• **Exposing Dangerous Operations**: Using `eval` for the calculator tool or opening a search to external URLs might pose security risks. Validate and sanitize inputs.

---

## Next Steps and Extensions

• **Authentication**: Integrate user authentication to secure endpoints and memory states.  
• **Enhanced Agents**: Use more advanced agent types with planning, robust error-handling, or custom logic.  
• **Tooling**: Add more domain-specific tools (financial calculators, other APIs, custom data sources).  
• **Advanced Memory**: Implement specialized memory modules, e.g., summary-based memory to handle long conversations.  
• **Scaling**: Deploy via containers, incorporate load balancing or serverless frameworks.  
• **Analytics and Logging**: Track usage patterns, prompt permutations, and performance metrics.  

By following the modular design and conceptual guidelines above, students can create a maintainable, scalable, and feature-rich LLM-driven application. Remember that clarity in architecture, minimal coupling between modules, and robust testing are crucial for making your `langchains` project successful and extensible.
